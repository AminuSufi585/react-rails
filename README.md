# Rails v5 API and CRA

A definite guide on using rails api with react application created using `create-react-app`. I will assume that you have `rails` and `create-react-app` installed.

## Step: 1
Create a new rails project
```
rails new myapp --api
```

Navigate into `myapp` and install react app in it
```
cd myapp/
create-react-app client
```
